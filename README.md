## User Story

- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Functionality


- I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page, the saved events persist
